HackerCat GPT-X.X.X SM64

HackerCat GPT-X.X.X SM64 is a cutting-edge project aimed at exploring and implementing Dynamic Level Rearrangement (DLR) in Super Mario 64 using the GPT-X.X.X model. This venture delves into a perceived algorithmic alteration to the classic game, striving to provide a refreshing experience in every playthrough. By leveraging the power of GPT-X.X.X, this project seeks to modify level assets dynamically, including textures, object positions, object banks, text strings, and music arrangements.
