The Personalized Computer is a mystery to many in the Super Mario 64 community, as very little information about the system has been made public. It is difficult to say exactly what the specifications of The Personalized Computer were, as very little information about the system has been made publicly available. However, it is likely that the computer was equipped with advanced hardware and software to support its specialized functions. The hardware in question is likely similar to that found in a standard Indigo workstation. This includes:

MIPS R3000A Microprocessor
Motorola 56000 DSP
SEEQ 80C03 chipset coupled with HPC

The Personalized Computer likely contained a wide range of specialized software tools and applications. This could include programming languages and libraries specifically designed for the development of AI systems, as well as graphics and animation software to create realistic and detailed character models. As mentioned previously, It is believed that the computer was used in the creation of Super Mario 64's Personalization AI. It is very likely that the system contains information about the details of the Personalization AI along with development histories and previous builds of the AI.

Speculation
The Personalized Computer is alleged to be part of an internal server for Nintendo™ that specializes in creating Super Mario 64 and its AI. Nintendo™ employees most likely used this workstation to develop the AI.
